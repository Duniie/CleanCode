the release of nutrients is NOT linearly related to increase sediment resuspension. Therefore a linear model is not the best way to analyse this data. A spearman analysis is more appropriate for data that presents a monotonic relationship, as it is the case here. 
For the Spearman analysis we will compare the nutrient concentration vs mass of resuspended sediment (g/L)
#Spearman analysis NOT INCLUDED IN THIS FILE

#Nutrient Fluxes calculation
##Nutrient fluxes over time linear model NOT INCLUDED IN this file
Calculation of nutrient fluxes over the whole duration (~ 1 hour) of the erosion experiment. All speeds included
 NOTE: the fluxes are not linear, they follow a monotonic relationship instead

##Nut Fluxes per speed function 
Here a different flux is calculated per each speed
we do not kill points because we only have a maximum of three data points per replicate
```{r}
FluxSpd <- function(Data = NutEro[NutEro$Speed != 0,], Sits, nut = c("NH4", "NO2", "NO3", "PO4", "DSi"), 
                    Data.acc = PP[,c(1:3,18:20)]) {
Fluxes <- Sites <- Location <- Reps <- Spee <-  Nuts <- Height <- BW <- RSQ <- AICs <- NULL
for (s in Sits) {
   SS       <- Data[Data$Site == s, ]
   Acc <- Data.acc[Data.acc$Site == s, ]
   Locat  <- unique(SS$Location)

   for (i in Locat) {
    Acc.loc <- subset(Acc, Acc$Location == i)
    Loc <- subset(SS, Location == i)
    repli    <- unique(Loc$Replicate)

for (ir in 1:length(repli)) {
      r <- repli[ir]
      Acc.r <- Acc.loc[ir, ]
      Rep <- subset(Loc, Replicate == r)
      Sped <- unique(Rep$Speed)

  for (n in 1:length(nut)) {
    Nutname <- nut[n]
     FN <- NULL

     for (p in 1:length(Sped)) {
       sp <- Sped[p]
       Spd <- subset(Rep, Speed == sp)

      flux <- lm(Spd[,Nutname] ~ Spd$Timed)
      prob <- summary(flux)$coefficients[2,"Pr(>|t|)"]
      Nutflux <- coef(flux)[2]*(Acc.r$HeightWat/100)

      rsq  <- summary(flux)$adj.r.squared

}
```
##Flux SPM function
A flux of SPM is also calculated (I am not sure this is useful)
```{r}
FluxSPM <- function(Data = NutEro[NutEro$Speed != 0 & !is.na(NutEro$Turbidity.gl),], Sits, Data.acc = PP[,c(1:3,18:20)]) {

Fluxes <- Sites <- Location <- Reps <- Spee <-Nuts <- Height <- BW <- RSQ <- AICs <- NULL

   Acc <- Data.acc[Data.acc$Site == s, ]

#Calculation of normal fluxes vs erosion fluxes
