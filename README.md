# CleanCode
 
This code is to analyse the release of nutrients from a mudflat called Paulina Polder.
The release of nutrients was caused by an experiment on sediment resuspension.
Two areas of the mudflat were visited and in each area a triplicate run was done.
Variation over time and with different speeds can be observed in the data
Different nutrients are analysed and each one of them behaves in a different manner.
