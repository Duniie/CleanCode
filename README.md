# CleanCode
 
This code is to analyse the release of nutrients from a mudflat called Paulina Polder.
In the autumn of 2020 we conducted an experiment in two locations (25 and 200m from the salt marsh edge.
At each location we placed a cilinder with a turbine on top to erode the sediment. We repeated this experiment three times at each location.
As soon as we started increasing the speed of the turbine the sediment started eroding. Thereafter we took water samples to measure how much nutrients were being released into the water column.
This code is part of the data analysis where we investigate the relationship between speed, time and nutrients released.
